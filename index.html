        <p>Hi! My name is Sherry L. Angle and I am embarking on a new career as a Web Developer. I am excited for this opportunity to learn a new skill. 
            I chose to be a Web Developer as I see it as an opening to learn a new Career field and to continually add to my knowledge with neverending 
            new technology. I am beginning this new adventure by taking the Full Stack Web Developement Bootcamp with TrueCoders. My goal is to successfully 
            complete the course with the knowledge and abilities to gain employment in this field. </p>

                <section>My life work experience has been varied, from working in the cornfields doing corn hybrid research,
             Retail Management in the oil and gas industry, Production of clients projects using digital printing and 
             various auxillary equipment. Of all of these experiences one thing remains the same- Teamwork. I have worked
             with many individuals and I have enjoyed the input from others to learn new things, share ideas, and to complete
             projects on time as a Team. I also take a personal pride in all I do, creating a product that makes me excited to work thru 
            and see the final project.</section>
